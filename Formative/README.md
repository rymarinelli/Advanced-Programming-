Data manipulation and outputs 
1. 1.	Outputs should not include any data from vendors that have a ‘PROGRAM STATUS’ of INACTIVE.
2.	The ‘PE DESCRIPTION’ column contains information on the number and type of seating available at the vendor. Extract this out into a new column, retain all other information within that column. E.g.: 
a.	‘FOOD MKT RETAIL (1-1,999 SF) LOW RISK’, 
b.	‘RESTAURANT (61-150) SEATS LOW RISK’.  
c.	Extract the greyed area out and retain the rest in the examples
d.	The client initially needs information to generate the following and output the results using appropriate representation:
3.	Produce the mean, mode and median for the inspection score per year:
a.	For each type of vendor’s seating
b.	For each ‘zip code’
4.	Produce a suitable graph that displays the number of establishments that have committed each type of violation, you may need to consider how you group this data to make visualisation feasible.
5.	Determine if there is any significant correlation between the number of violations committed per vendor and their zip code, ‘Is there a tendency for facilities in specific locations to have more violations?’. You will need to select an appropriate visualisation to demonstrate this.
