<h3> Question 1 </h3>
<h2> From the perspective of events and states consider the following processes (systems) and sketch out what events there are and how they change the state of objects within the system:
</h2>

In starting the algroithm, the first step is boiling water. In this step a kettle is placed on a burner until it reaches 100 degrees and starts to boil.
Reaching this temperature is the trigger, and it changes the state of the water. The water then is poured into a cup, and a teabag is placed into the heating water. 
The tea will then spread from the tea bag as warm water and changes state once again from water to tea. 

With a different scenario, a self-driving car, the system is more complex. With a self-driving car, there are various sensors that are taking input and setting off various triggers 
as the state changes. For instance, there is a sensor checking for obstructions. If the sensor determines a change of state from when there is no obstruction to one where there 
one, it may stop the car. There are also senors determining weather and other road conditions. If the senors determine a change in the state of weather to a dangerous condition, 
it may trigger additional triggers. For instance, if the state of weather changes to snow, the car may change the max speed to allow for safer travel.
