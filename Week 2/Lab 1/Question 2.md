<h3> Why is the concept of ‘types’ important? </h3>
Types are important for data quality and adhereing to OOP concepts. 

<h3>What would be the advantages and/or disadvantages if there were no types?</h3>
If there are no types, it will make storage more flexible. You can consider blob storage. However, it may make the data harder to use down the line in processing. 

<h3> Considering some programming languages adhere to the principle of “Duck typing”, would this be a better approach to structuring documents for use with programs? </h3>
I suppose it down the particular usecase. If a document has the core elements needed, which duck typing would check for, then it might be good enough. More structured documents like XML
simply prioritize data quality.
