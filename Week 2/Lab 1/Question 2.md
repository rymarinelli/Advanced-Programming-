<h3> Why is the concept of ‘types’ important? </h3>
Types are important for data quality and adhereing to OOP concepts. 

<h3>What would be the advantages and/or disadvantages if there were no types?</h3>
If there are no types, it will make storage more flexible. You can consider blob storage. However, it may make the data harder to use down the line in processing. 

<h3> Considering some programming languages adhere to the principle of “Duck typing”, would this be a better approach to structuring documents for use with programs? </h3>
I suppose it down the particular usecase. If a document has the core elements needed, which duck typing would check for, then it might be good enough. More structured documents like XML simply prioritize data quality.

<h3>Both JSON and XML are considered semi-structured data representations, whereas CSV is classified more towards unstructured, or minimally structured. There are considerable overheads with writing both JSON and XML, whereas CSV has been and is still used effectively.
What do we gain from semi-structured data, and given the current advances in application development, is this gain essential to moving technology forward?</h3>
I think it comes down to what the priorities are with the data. If you want data that is high quality, then using JSON makes sense. The other consideration is about how the systems are producing the data. Less structured data will have less influence baked into its processing. These values allow more meaning to be imbued into the data.
